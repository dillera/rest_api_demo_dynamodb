Note: Intentionally using Python 2.7 to be able to deploy on AWS Lambda.


## Testing

Assuming you have installed it via `brew` you can start local DynamoDB with:
 
    brew services start rjcoelho/boneyard/dynamodb-local
    
You should now be able to access your local DynamoDB on localhost port 8000.
